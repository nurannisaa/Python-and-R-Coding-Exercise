# Python & R Coding Exercise
A collection of Python & R Coding Exercise

## Description
This repository contains a collection of coding exercises that I have done since the first time I started learning data science and programming languages.
Here's the list of content about what I have done in each coding exercise :
1. Exercise 1 (R)
    - Looping : Print out integers which are multiples of some value
    - Checking a prime number
2. Exercise 2 (R)
    - Find participant with the 3rd highest score
    - Find the Square Root of second degree polynomial function
    - Find distance between two coordinates (easy)
3. Exercise 3 (Python)
    - Count how many times a substring appears in a string
    - Count how many different letters in an input string
    - Find distance between two coordinates (medium)
 4. Exercise 4 (Python)
    - Shifting members of an array
    - Generate the n-th row of "Pascal's Triangle"
    - Find maximum distance between 3 points
 5. Exercise 5 (Python)
    - Find the greatest possible combination
    - Position in repeating series
 6. Exercise 6 (Python)
    - Create dictionary from 2 lists
    - Guess the next fibonacci number after inputing a number
    - Scoring two sets of selection
 7. Exercise 7 (R)
    - Calculate the difference between two input dates
    - Find the name of the day from the input
 8. Exercise 8 (R)
    - Find out students with only one extra curricular activity
    - Find three most common letter from a string
 9. Exercise 9 (Python)
    - Find at which index is the maximum value of each row in a dataframe
    - Python numpy : avoid looping while doing things that require certain conditions
    - Convert an array of integers into one hot encoding
